       Climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has emerged to address climate-change related challenges linked with cocoa production, as well as to improve smallholder incomes. In concurrence with the global emergence of CSA, the concept of climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has become a new umbrella term for sustainability and supply-chain initiatives in order to deal with the multiple challenges in the Nigerian cocoa sector. The CSC program rests on the same three principle foundations that support CSA, namely; productivity, adaptation, and mitigation.

         What is climate-smart cocoa?
         <div class="para col-12 mt-2">
           Climate-smart cocoa refers to the sustainable production of cocoa while mitigating and adapting to climate change. It involves implementing agricultural practices and techniques that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and promote resilience in cocoa farming systems.
           <br />
           <br />
         The productivity pillar seeks to optimize yields and quality in relation to the inputs needed. In other words, the ratio of the value of production and the cost of inputs increases (output-input ratio). Higher farm profitability should lead to a decent income that ensures food security, higher wages, and investment capacity. Adaptation embodies the need for long-term resilience to climate change, as well as farmer capacity to minimize short-term risks and prevent long-term stresses. Finally, wherever possible, CSC ties in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions to the previous objectives, helping to reduce the contribution of cocoa to climate change. Finally, the CSC program works alongside a number of programs, such as the UTZ Sector Partnerships program and the Cocoa and Forests Initiative to attain the aforementioned objectives.

                 <span class="csc">CSC</span> is different from conventional cocoa production because it takes into account the specific challenges posed by climate change and aims to address them in a sustainable and resilient manner. Here are some key ways in which climate-smart cocoa differs from conventional cocoa production:
                 <br />
<br />
1. Climate change mitigation: Efforts are made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cocoa production. This can include adopting improved land management practices, such as agroforestry systems that integrate shade trees, which sequester carbon dioxide and enhance biodiversity.
<br />
<br />
2. Climate change adaptation: Adaptation measures are implemented to help cocoa farmers cope with the impacts of climate change. These may involve promoting crop diversification, introducing drought-resistant cocoa varieties, and implementing irrigation systems to ensure water availability during dry periods.
<br />
<br />
3. Sustainable farming practices: Climate-smart cocoa promotes sustainable agricultural practices, such as integrated pest management, soil conservation, and efficient water management. These practices help maintain soil fertility, reduce water consumption, and minimize the use of chemical inputs.
<br />
<br />
4. Farmer capacity building: Training and knowledge sharing programs are essential components of climate-smart cocoa initiatives. Farmers are educated about climate change impacts, provided with practical techniques to implement sustainable practices, and given access to climate information and early warning systems.
<br />
<br />
5. Market access and value chain integration: Climate-smart cocoa aims to link farmers with markets that value sustainably produced cocoa. By integrating smallholder farmers into sustainable supply chains, they can receive fair prices for their products and benefit from the value-added opportunities associated with climate-smart cocoa.
<br />
<br />
<span class="csc">CSC</span> goes beyond the farm level with its additional consideration of the landscape level and the whole supply chain. CSC plans are developed with the specific characteristics and most prevalent risks of each climate impact zone in mind, leaving room for the producer to prioritize different options according to his needs and situation. Moreover, monitoring and evaluation of outcomes, as well as the exploration of other potential CSC themes are also part of the CSC program.
